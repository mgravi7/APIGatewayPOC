## Current Limitations (By Design for POC)

These are intentional for the POC phase and will be addressed in future phases:

- Mock data used (no database yet) - **Phase 2 or 3**
- Read-only operations (GET only) - **Phase 3**
- No authentication/authorization - **Phase 2 (Keycloak)**
- No rate limiting - **Phase 4**
- No distributed tracing - **Phase 4**
