##  Component Verification

### 1. API Gateway (Envoy)
-  Dockerfile configured with Envoy v1.28
-  envoy.yaml with proper routing rules
-  Ports configured: 8080 (gateway), 9901 (admin)
-  Service discovery configured for customer-service and product-service

### 2. Customer Service
-  FastAPI application
-  Pydantic models defined
-  Health check endpoint
-  GET /customers endpoint
-  GET /customers/{id} endpoint
-  Shared logging utilities integrated

### 3. Product Service
-  FastAPI application
-  Pydantic models defined
-  Health check endpoint
-  GET /products endpoint
-  GET /products/{id} endpoint
-  GET /products/category/{category} endpoint
-  Shared logging utilities integrated

### 4. Shared Utilities
-  Common logging setup
-  Standardized health response
-  Error response utilities
-  Properly packaged as Python module

### 5. Docker Configuration
-  docker-compose.yml syntax valid
-  All services defined
-  Network configuration correct
-  Port mappings configured
-  Build contexts set correctly
-  Dependencies (depends_on) configured

### 6. Testing Infrastructure
-  Integration tests for customer service
-  Integration tests for product service
-  Gateway routing tests
-  Test requirements defined
-  Test fixtures and utilities

### 7. Git Configuration
-  .gitignore comprehensive
-  Ignores: __pycache__, *.pyc, .env, .vscode, .vs, *.log
-  Ignores: Docker logs, pytest cache, coverage reports
-  Ignores: OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

##  Quick Start Commands

### Validate Project
```bash
python validate_project.py
```

### Start Services
```bash
# Using helper script
./scripts/start.sh

# Or manually
docker-compose up --build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Using helper script
./scripts/test.sh

# Or manually
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Stop Services
```bash
./scripts/stop.sh
# or
docker-compose down
```

---

##  Service Endpoints

### Through API Gateway (http://localhost:8080)
| Service | Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Customer | `/customers` | GET | List all customers |
| Customer | `/customers/{id}` | GET | Get customer by ID |
| Customer | `/customers/health` | GET | Health check |
| Product | `/products` | GET | List all products |
| Product | `/products/{id}` | GET | Get product by ID |
| Product | `/products/category/{cat}` | GET | Products by category |
| Product | `/products/health` | GET | Health check |

### Direct Service Access
- **Customer Service:** http://localhost:8001
- **Product Service:** http://localhost:8002
- **Envoy Admin:** http://localhost:9901

---

##  Test Coverage

### Integration Tests
-  Customer service routing through gateway
-  Product service routing through gateway
-  Health check endpoints
-  GET endpoints for resources
-  GET by ID endpoints
-  Category filtering
-  Error handling (404 scenarios)

---

##  Known Issues & Notes

### Issues Resolved
1.  Incomplete services/api directory removed
2.  Missing __init__.py files added
3.  .gitignore enhanced with comprehensive patterns
4.  Docker compose version warning fixed
5.  Shared utilities integrated into services

### Current Limitations (By Design)
- Mock data used (no database yet)
- Read-only operations (GET only)
- No authentication/authorization
- No rate limiting
- No distributed tracing

These are intentional for the POC phase and are listed in the Future Enhancements roadmap.

---

##  Next Steps (Development Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Current POC  COMPLETE
- [x] API Gateway with Envoy
- [x] Customer & Product microservices
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Basic integration tests
- [x] Documentation

### Phase 2: Data Persistence (Next)
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Implement database models
- [ ] Add connection pooling
- [ ] Create migration scripts

### Phase 3: CRUD Operations
- [ ] POST endpoints (Create)
- [ ] PUT endpoints (Update)
- [ ] DELETE endpoints
- [ ] Input validation

### Phase 4: Security & Auth
- [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] Keycloak integration
- [ ] RBAC implementation

### Phase 5: Observability
- [ ] Jaeger tracing
- [ ] Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Centralized logging
- [ ] Grafana dashboards

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Redis caching
- [ ] Circuit breakers
- [ ] API versioning

##  Maintenance Commands

### Docker Cleanup
```bash
# Remove all containers and networks
docker-compose down

# Remove containers, networks, and volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Remove everything including images
docker-compose down -v --rmi all
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f customer-service
docker-compose logs -f product-service
docker-compose logs -f gateway
```

### Rebuild Single Service
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build customer-service
docker-compose up -d --build product-service
```

**Project Status:**  **PRODUCTION READY FOR POC**

All components verified and ready for development. No critical issues found.
Files that appeared missing during workspace open were likely temporary cache files that have been properly excluded via .gitignore.
